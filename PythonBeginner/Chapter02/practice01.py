# write a program to add any two numbers

a = 4 
b = 8
print (a+b)

# now by taking input from keyboard and then adding this numbers

c =int( input ("enter first number"))
d =int( input ("enter second number")) 
print (c+d)
#as we know taking input form the keyboard is in the form of string to and integers we have to assign it the integer data type
